              <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
              <p>
                A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard built with high quality,
                typically spring activated, key switches. These key switches
                vary based on the keyboard’s application or user preference.
                While some of the first widely sold keyboards such as IBM’s
                Model M in the 1980’s utilized mechanical switches, the 1990’s
                brought on a wave of inexpensive rubber dome keyboards that
                flooded the keyboard market. Rubber dome keyboards represent
                over 90% of keyboards in use today and provide an inexpensive
                but dissatisfying feel and typing experience.
              </p>
              <h2>Different size keyboards</h2>
              <div class="column">
                <h3>Full size</h3>
                <img
                  class="main-image"
                  src="./assets/fullsize.png"
                  alt="Full sized keybaord"
                />
                <p>
                  The keyboard layout that most people are familiar with. Full
                  size keyboards come with anywhere from 104 to 108 keys and
                  typically span 22.5u or roughly 427.5mm in width, outside of
                  specialty keyboards, they’re the widest option keyboard. 100%
                  keyboards have the full spaced out function keys, arrow
                  cluster, navigation and numpad with separation to easily
                  identify keys.
                </p>
                <h3>Tenkeyless (TKL)</h3>
                <img
                  class="main-image"
                  src="./assets/tkl.png"
                  alt="Tenkeyless keyboard"
                />
                <p>
                  This is a compact fersion of the full size. It doesn't have
                  the numpad. But it does have the arro cluster and the function
                  keys. It is a good option if you are not using the numpad but
                  want to keep the arrows and the function keys.
                </p>
                <h3>75% keyboard</h3>
                <img
                  class="main-image"
                  src="./assets/75.png"
                  alt="75% keybaord"
                />
                <p>
                  The 75% is a compact TKL. It doesn't have lock and pause key.
                  And the right shift and ctrl keys are smaller.
                </p>
                <h3>65% keyboard</h3>
                <img
                  class="main-image"
                  src="./assets/65.png"
                  alt="65% keyboard"
                />
                <p>
                  The 65% is the same width as the 75%.It is without the
                  function keys.
                </p>
                <h3>60% keyboard</h3>
                <img
                  class="main-image"
                  src="./assets/60.png"
                  alt="60% keyboard"
                />
                <p>
                  If you don't have desk space this is probably the best choice
                  for you. It doesn't have function keys as the 65%. The arrow
                  and navigaion keys as missing as well.
                </p>
                <h2>Keycaps</h2>
                <p>
                  A keycap is the plastic covering on top of each key switch
                  that identifies the letter or symbol input into the computer.
                  Casual users are content with stock keycaps, but keyboard
                  enthusiasts often switch keycaps out for custom options.
                </p>
                <h2>Why Get a New Keycap Set?</h2>
                <p>
                  With the exceptions of very expensive mechanical keyboards,
                  most keyboards come with very cheap and mass-produced keycaps
                  that make the keyboard dull and bland. The keycaps are what
                  your going to be looking and typing on during the entire
                  lifespan of your keyboard, so shouldn’t they be one of the
                  nicest parts of the keyboard? There are many benefits to
                  getting new keycaps, and they can make a $50 keyboard feel
                  like a $150 one for a relatively cheap price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main benefits are the aesthetics as you are able to choose
                  the color and design of the keycaps which will allow the RGB
                  lighting to flourish. The keycaps also are more durable, which
                  means the legends won’t slowly disappear after some heavy use.
                  In addition, by customizing the profile design you will have a
                  keycap set that feels comfortable and efficient to type on.
                  There are a lot of different styles of keycaps sets out there
                  so let’s go over some of the different options and features.
                </p>
                <h2>What is the Best Keycap Material?</h2>
                <p>
                  In the world of keycaps, there is really two main material
                  types you can get; ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and
                  PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate). You may be wondering, what
                  the heck is ABS & PBT? Well, they are two different types of
                  plastic with different property qualities. Both types of
                  plastic have a different feel, sound, and look to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ABS keycaps are the cheapest and most common plastic used for
                  keycaps. ABS keycaps are mass produced because of how easily
                  they are injection molded. PBT plastic is less common but is
                  usually higher quality than ABS. ABS keycaps feel smooth and
                  develop a greasy shine over time, while PBT keycaps feel
                  textured and are more durable. PBT are considered superior to
                  ABS since they are more durable and wear down less over time.

        <h2>Switches</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most essential part in a mechanical keyboard is the
          switch.Based on their characteristics, there are basically three types
          of mechanical switches: Linear switches, tactile switches and clicky
          switches.
        </p>
        <img class="aside-img" src="./assets/linear.png" alt="Linear switch" />
        <p class="aside-text">
          Linear (You can see the red switch) switches are the simplest ones.
          They feel the same from the moment you start pressing the key until
          bottoming out. There is no tactile feedback or noise when hitting the
          actuation point (the point where the keypress gets registered –
          usually somewhere in the middle). So, most of the time, you will
          probably bottom out on each key press.
        </p>
        <img
          class="aside-img"
          src="./assets/tactile.png"
          alt="Tactile switch"
        />
        <p class="aside-text">
          Tactile (You can see the brown switch) switches provide tactile
          feedback, when hitting the actuation point. As you press the key down,
          the swithc provides a small bump, which lets you know, that your key
          press got successfully registered. They are ideal for typing because
          you get a slight indication of a keypress without needing to bottom
          out your keys.
        </p>
        <img class="aside-img" src="./assets/clicky.png" alt="Clicky switch" />
        <p class="aside-text">
          Clicky (You can see the blue switch) switches provide an additional
          click sound, when hitting the actuation point. The main advantage of
          tactile and clicky switches is that you don’t have to push the key all
          the way down. You can release the key immediately after you receive
          the feedback.Clicky switches are purposely designed to be loud—mainly
          as added feedback when typing.
        </p>
        <img
          class="aside-img"
          src="./assets/optical.gif"
          alt="Optical switch"
        />
        <p class="aside-text">
          There is one more type of switches it is the optical switch(You can
          see the purple switch). Simply put, optical keyboard switches differ
          from typical mechanical switches in that they use light for actuation
          instead of a mechanical connection. Of course, there’s more to the
          story. They split in the exact three types linear, tactile,click.
