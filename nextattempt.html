                        <h1>Mechanical Keyboards</h1>
                        <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
                        <p >
                            A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard built with high quality, typically spring activated, key switches. These key switches vary based on the keyboard’s application or user preference.
                            While some of the first widely sold keyboards such as IBM’s Model M in the 1980’s utilized mechanical switches, the 1990’s brought on a wave of inexpensive rubber dome keyboards that flooded the keyboard market. Rubber dome keyboards represent over 90% of keyboards in use today and provide an inexpensive but dissatisfying feel and typing experience.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Different size keyboards</h2>
                            <h3 >Full size</h3>
                                <img class="main-image" src="fullsize.png" alt="Full sized keybaord">
                                <p > The keyboard layout that most people are familiar with.
                                Full size keyboards come with anywhere from 104 to 108 keys and typically span 22.5u or roughly 427.5mm in width, outside of specialty keyboards, they’re the widest option keyboard.
                                100% keyboards have the full spaced out function keys, arrow cluster, navigation and numpad with separation to easily identify keys.
                                </p>
                            <h3 >Tenkeyless (TKL)</h3>
                                <img class="main-image" src="tkl.png" alt="Tenkeyless keyboard">
                                <p>This is a compact fersion of the full size. It doesn't have the numpad. But it does have the arro cluster and the function keys. It is a good option if you are not using the numpad but want to keep the arrows and the function keys.
                                </p>
                            <h3 >75% keyboard</h3>
                                <img class="main-image" src="75.png" alt="75% keybaord">
                                <p >The 75% is a compact TKL. It doesn't have lock and pause key. And the right shift and ctrl keys are smaller. </p>
                            <h3 >65% keyboard</h3>
                                <img class="main-image" src="65.png" alt="65% keyboard">
                                <p>The 65% is the same width as the 75%.It is without the function keys.</p>
                           <h3 >60% keyboard</h3>
                                <img class="main-image" src="60.png" alt="60% keyboard">
                                <p >If you don't have desk space this is probably the best choice for you. It doesn't have function keys as the 65%. The arrow and navigaion keys as missing as well.</p>

            <h2>Switches</h2>
            <p >One of the most essential part in a mechanical keyboard is the switch.Based on their characteristics, there are basically three types of mechanical switches: Linear switches, tactile switches and clicky switches.</p>
            <p >Linear (The red one in the image below) switches are the simplest ones. They feel the same from the moment you start pressing the key until bottoming out. There is no tactile feedback or noise when hitting the actuation point (the point where the keypress gets registered – usually somewhere in the middle). So, most of the time, you will probably bottom out on each key press.</p>
            <img class="aside-img" src="linear.png" alt="Linear switch">
            <p >Tactile (The brown one in the image below) switches provide tactile feedback, when hitting the actuation point. As you press the key down, you will notice a small bump, which lets you know, that your key press got successfully registered. </p>
            <img class="aside-img" src="tactile.png" alt="Tactile switch">
            <p > Clicky (The blue one in the image below) switches provide an additional click sound, when hitting the actuation point. The main advantage of tactile and clicky switches is that you don’t have to push the key all the way down. You can release the key immediately after you receive the feedback.</p>
            <img class="aside-img" src="clicky.png" alt="Clicky switch">
            <p>There is one more type of switches it is the optical switch. Simply put, optical keyboard switches differ from typical mechanical switches in that they use light for actuation instead of a mechanical connection. Of course, there’s more to the story. They split in the exact three types linear, tactile,click.</p>
