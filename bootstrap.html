                  <p>
                    Want to know what hardware is in your computer? Become a
                    computer pro with our quick guide to these essential
                    components and their roles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quite simply, computer hardware is the physical components
                    that a computer system requires to function. It encompasses
                    everything with a circuit board that operates within a PC or
                    laptop; including the motherboard, graphics card, CPU
                    (Central Processing Unit), ventilation fans, power supply,
                    and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    lthough the design of hardware differs between desktop PCs
                    and laptops due to their differences in size, the same core
                    components will be found in both. Without hardware, there
                    would be no way of running the essential software that makes
                    computers so useful. Software is defined as the virtual
                    programs that run on your computer; that is, operating
                    system, internet browser, word-processing documents, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although a computer can function only when both hardware and
                    software are working together, the speed of a system will
                    largely rely on the hardware used.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When building up a new computer, or simply replacing old
                    parts, you may need to know the specific hardware in your
                    computer. The purpose of this guide is therefore to help you
                    understand the inner-workings of your computer.

                  <p class="m-3 justify-content-center">
                    The motherboard is at the center of what makes a PC work. It
                    houses the CPU and is a hub that all other hardware runs
                    through. The motherboard acts as a brain; allocating power
                    where it’s needed, communicating with and coordinating
                    across all other components – making it one of the most
                    important pieces of hardware in a computer.

                  <p class="m-3">
                    The CPU (Central Processing Unit or processor) is
                    responsible for processing all information from programs run
                    by your computer. The ‘clock speed’, or the speed at which
                    the processor processes information, is measured in
                    gigahertz (GHz). This means that a processor advertising a
                    high GHz rating will likely perform faster than a similarly
                    specified processor of the same brand and age.

                  <p class="m-3 justify-content-center">
                    Random Access Memory, or RAM, is hardware found in the
                    memory slots of the motherboard. The role of RAM is to
                    temporarily store on-the-fly information created by programs
                    and to do so in a way that makes this data immediately
                    accessible. The tasks that require random memory could be;
                    rendering images for graphic design, edited video or
                    photographs, multi-tasking with multiple apps open (for
                    example, running a game on one screen and chatting via
                    Discord on the other).

                  <p class="m-3">
                    The hard drive is a storage device responsible for storing
                    permanent and temporary data. This data comes in many
                    different forms, but is essentially anything saved or
                    installed to a computer: for example, computer programs,
                    family photos, operating system, word-processing documents,
                    and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p class="m-3">
                    There are two different types of storage devices: the
                    traditional hard disk drive (HDD) and the newer solid state
                    drives (SSD). Hard disk drives work by writing binary data
                    onto spinning magnetic disks called platters that rotate at
                    high speeds, while a solid-state drive stores data by using
                    static flash memory chips.

                    What is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)?
                  </h2>
                  <p class="m-3">
                    Especially important for 3D rendering, the GPU does exactly
                    what its name suggests and processes huge batches of graphic
                    data. You will find that your computer’s graphics card has
                    at least one GPU. As opposed to the basic on-board graphic
                    capabilities that PC motherboards supply, dedicated graphics
                    cards interface with the motherboard via an expansion slot
                    to work almost exclusively on graphic rendering. This also
                    means you can upgrade your graphics card if you want to get
                    a bit more performance from your PC.

                  </h2>
                  <p class="m-3">
                    A power supply unit, commonly abbreviated as PSU, does more
                    than just supply your computer with power. It is the point
                    where power enters your system from an external power source
                    and is then allocated by the motherboard to individual
                    component hardware. Not all power supplies are made equally
                    however, and without the right wattage PSU your system will
                    fail to work.
                  </p>
                  <p class="m-3">
                    Without the right amount of power, components won’t be able
                    to run effectively and the computer might experience crashes
                    or simply fail to boot at all. It’s recommended to have a
                    power supply that more than covers your system usage. Not
                    only do you guard yourself against system failure, you also
                    future-proof yourself against needing a new PSU when you
                    upgrade to more powerful PC components.

                    An optical disc drive (ODD) in a computer system allows you
                    to use CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs to listen to music or
                    watch a movie. Most drives also allow you to write data to a
                    disc, so you can create your own music CDs, video DVDs or
                    even create of back-up copy of your important data files.

                  <p class="m-3">
                    A heatsink is a piece of metal that sits on top of a
                    computer chip such as a CPU and draws power away from
                    components by letting it rise through a set of fins. By
                    themselves, heatsinks are passive; they have no moving
                    parts. However, in most cases--especially with desktop CPUs
                    and GPUs--the heatsink is combined with a fan that blows the
                    hot air away or a liquid cooling solution that carries the
                    heat away through pipes.
